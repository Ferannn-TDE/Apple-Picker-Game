# Apple-Picker-Game
Apple Picker - Enhanced Edition
A 3D arcade-style catching game built with Unity where players control baskets to catch falling apples while avoiding dangerous branches!
Description
Apple Picker is a fun, fast-paced game where you move baskets left and right to catch apples falling from a moving tree. Score points by catching apples, but watch out - catching a branch means instant game over! The game features multiple rounds with increasing difficulty as you lose baskets.

Branch Obstacle: Occasionally branches fall from the tree - catch one and it's game over!
Round Counter: Progress through 4 rounds as you lose baskets
Start Screen: Clean UI with a start button to begin the game
High Score Tracking: Your best score is saved using PlayerPrefs
Restart Button: Easy restart when the game ends
Responsive Controls: Smooth mouse-controlled basket movement
